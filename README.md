Ouranos
=======

Ouranos is a web application that can be used in parallel to 
[Gaia](https://gitlab.com/eupla/gaia.git) in order to provide a graphical user
interface to it, allowing easier environment configuration, but also draw graphs,
analyse plants health...

This repository only contains the backend web API for Ouranos. In order to
get the graphical web app, you need to build the Vue.js 
[Ouranos-web-frontend](#) and copy it to the static folder.

Note
----
Ouranos requires [event-dispatcher](https://gitlab.com/eupla/dispatcher.git) in 
order to work.

Ouranos is still in development and might not work properly.
